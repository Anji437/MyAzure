ir, My PF account No,AP/6202/238. Earlier i have been getting pension from PF Authorities, KADAPA. Suddenly it was stopped even though i submitted JEEVAN PRAMAAN CERTIFICATE.
MY NAME IS K V R VENKATESAN.

Please let me know what is the problem in sending my PF Pension amount. Why PF officials want to harass old persons like me who are at their mercy?
